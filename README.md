# Wealthify - BlackRock Hackathon 2024  [![Visit Wealthify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visit%20Wealthify-Vercel-blue)](https://wealthify01.vercel.app/)
A web application designed to provide **Financial Education and Management for Students**. Built during a 24-hour hackathon by BlackRock in July 2024, Wealthify helps students find relevant courses based on their queries, through both text and voice input.

## Features  
- **User-friendly interface**: After logging in, students receive a pop-up form where they can submit course-related queries either by typing or speaking.
  
- **Speech-to-text functionality**: Queries spoken by users are converted into text using the speech recognition library and processed in the backend to match relevant courses from the database.

- **Course suggestions**: The system suggests the **top 5 courses** based on the user's query by searching through a rich course database.

- **WhatsApp integration with Twilio**: 
    - Users receive personalized course suggestions through WhatsApp messages.
    - We implemented a **"Call Me"** feature, which allows users to receive a phone call with detailed course explanations.

- **AI-powered responses**: Integrated with **OpenAI** to generate more personalized and insightful responses to student queries.

- **Proactive user engagement**: If a student purchases a course and doesn't log in for more than two days, they receive a reminder via WhatsApp to help keep them on track with their learning.

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: React, Vercel
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Third-party Services**: Twilio, OpenAI API
